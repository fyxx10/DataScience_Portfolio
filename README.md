# Airbnb Listings Analysis: Project Overview
* Analysed Airbnb listings data to help gain understanding on the factors that influence price among different neighbourhoods and neighbourhood groups.
* Data from minoHealth AI.
* Cleaned and prepared data for effective use by handling missing values and conducting other data manipulation techiniques using pandas.
* Performed exploratory data analysis to establish relevant relationships between variables and gain insights. 
* Built appropriate machine learning models (linear regression, lasso regression, random forest and gradient boosting) to predict price of listings.
* Evaluated models using MAE, MSE and RMSE
* Conducted feature importance to know the degree to which variables affect the models

# Food Security Analysis: Project Overview
* Analysed household food security data to help gain understanding on the factors that influence food security levels among different households.
* Data from the 3rd edition Data Hackathon Competition in the University of Ghana.
* Cleaned and prepared data for effective use.
* Performed exploratory data analysis to establish relevant relationships between variables. 
* Built appropriate machine learning models (decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting) to predict food security status
* Optimized models using the GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Conducted feature importance to know the degree to which variables affect the models

# Heart Condition Analysis: Project Overview
* Created a model to predict heart condition(whether poor or good) based on certain defined variable input.
* Downloaded data from Kaggle.
* Cleaned data using various data manipulation techniques in python (pandas).
* Checked for missing data and handled appropriately so that data would be consistent.
* Performed exploratory data analysis to establish relevant relationships between variables. 
* Built the logistic regression model and evaluted with accuracy score.

# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Downloaded already scraped data of over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor for my analysis.
* Performed exploratory data analysis to establish relevant relationships between variables. 
* Built appropriate machine learning models (linear multiple regression, lasso regression, random forest regressor) and optimized using the GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
