# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 12K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Downloaded already scraped data of over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor for my analysis.
* Performed exploratory data analysis to establish relevant relationships between variables. 
* Built appropriate machine learning models (linear multiple regression, lasso regression, random forest regressor) and optimized using the GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
